<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>MiniKhata does not collect, transmit, or store your financial ledger data on external servers. All transaction and ledger information is stored locally on your device.</p>

<h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
<p>All entries, transactions, and generated reports remain on your device. If you uninstall the app, locally stored data may be removed unless backed up by you.</p>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>MiniKhata uses Google AdMob to display banner, interstitial, and rewarded advertisements.</p>
<p>AdMob may automatically collect certain information such as:</p>
<ul>

<h2>4. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
<p>Premium features are offered through subscription plans processed securely by Google Play Billing.</p>
<p>We do not collect or store payment information such as credit card numbers.</p>
<p>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled through your Google Play account before the renewal date.</p>

<h2>5. Exported Files</h2>
<p>PDF reports generated by MiniKhata are saved to your device’s Downloads folder using Android system storage mechanisms. We do not access or upload these files.</p>

<h2>6. Permissions</h2>
<p>The app may request access to device storage solely for the purpose of saving exported PDF reports.</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable safeguards within the app; however, no digital system is completely secure. Users are responsible for safeguarding their own device.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>MiniKhata is not directed to children under 13 years of age and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
